#Delta-Auto-Calibration-Source
This is the new location for the source files for the delta kinematics auto calibration program that I am working on. This is not guaranteed to always work, I will upload the stabile versions to my Google Drive and will post them on the forum.

I will not be responsible for any damage to your printer, especially if you are not careful with the program. Serial ports tend to have buffer issues, so always stay close to your printer when running any version of this software.

If you would like to contribute to the main project, then send me an email at steventrowland (at) gmail.com or message me on the SeeMeCNC forum.
